						<p>Judith Scott, Untitled, 2004, fiber, found objects, 29 x 16 x 21</p>
					</div>
					<p>American artist Scott created over 200 cocoon-like sculptures while participating in the art program at the Creative Growth Art 
					Center in Oakland, the first organization to provide studio space for people with disabilities. Showing little interest in artmaking
					during her first two years at the center, Scott began her textile practice in 1987 after taking a course with the visiting fiber artist 
					Sylvia Seventy. </P>
					
					<p>Working at a frantic pace, Scott would wrap yarn, fabric, and other colorful fibers around found objects like broomsticks 
					and shopping carts, often engulfing these items so thoroughly that they would become unrecognizable. Scott spent weeks—sometimes even months—on 
					each sculpture, working up until her death in 2005. Considered to be an “outsider artist,” Scott was born with Down syndrome and became deaf 
					during her infancy. She had lived in a state-run institution in Ohio for 35 years before moving to California.</p>
